Here's a comprehensive checklist to help you prepare Biodiversity Dashboard package for CRAN submission:

## Before Submission

### Package Structure and Documentation

-   [ ] Update package version in DESCRIPTION file
-   [ ] Check that all dependencies are properly declared in DESCRIPTION (Imports, Suggests, Depends)
-   [ ] Ensure all exported functions have proper documentation (\@export, \@examples, etc.)
-   [ ] Update NEWS.md with changes in the new version
-   [ ] Update README.md with current information
-   [ ] Check that vignettes are up-to-date and build correctly
-   [ ] Ensure LICENSE file matches license declared in DESCRIPTION

### Code Quality

-   [ ] Run R CMD check --as-cran locally and fix all errors, warnings, and notes
-   [ ] Run `devtools::check()` or `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(args = c("--as-cran"))`
-   [ ] Check package with R-devel if possible
-   [ ] Run `devtools::spell_check()` to check spelling
-   [ ] Run `goodpractice::gp()` for additional best practices

### Testing

-   [ ] Ensure tests cover all main functionality
-   [ ] Run `devtools::test()` to run all tests
-   [ ] Check test coverage with `covr::package_coverage()`
-   [ ] Test on multiple platforms if possible (Windows, macOS, Linux)
-   [ ] Test with different R versions if possible

### CRAN Specific Checks

-   [ ] Ensure package size is under 5MB (or have a good reason if larger)
-   [ ] Ensure examples, vignettes, and tests run in under 5 seconds each
-   [ ] Check that no code writes to the user's home directory without permission
-   [ ] Ensure no examples/tests write to system files or directories
-   [ ] Check that `\dontrun{}` is only used when necessary
-   [ ] Ensure functions don't modify user options without resetting them

### Final Preparations

-   [ ] Build source package with `devtools::build()`
-   [ ] Check the package against CRAN policy with `devtools::check_rhub()`
-   [ ] Check on win-builder with `devtools::check_win_devel()`
-   [ ] Update cran-comments.md with:
    -   [ ] R CMD check results
    -   [ ] Downstream dependencies check results (if applicable)
    -   [ ] Explanation for any NOTE/WARNING that cannot be fixed
    -   [ ] Explanation of changes if this is an update

## Submission Process

### Submission Steps

-   [ ] Submit to CRAN using `devtools::release()` or via the web form
-   [ ] Wait for confirmation email from CRAN
-   [ ] Address any feedback from CRAN maintainers promptly

## Post-Submission

-   [ ] Once accepted, tag the release in git
-   [ ] Create a GitHub release (if using GitHub)
-   [ ] Announce the release (Twitter, blog, mailing lists, etc.)
-   [ ] Update package website if using pkgdown

## Additional Considerations

-   [ ] Check that URLs in documentation are valid with `urlchecker::url_check()`
-   [ ] If using compiled code, ensure it works across platforms
-   [ ] Check if there are reverse dependencies that need testing
-   [ ] Run `revdepcheck::revdep_check()` if you have reverse dependencies
