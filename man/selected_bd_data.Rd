\usage{
selected_bd_data(
  data = load_bd_data(),
  radio_btn_search_by_name,
  radio_btn_search_by_name_id,
  search_by_ver_or_sci_name,
  selected_by_ver_or_sci_name
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame. The biodiversity dataset to filter.}

\item{radio_btn_search_by_name}{Character. The current value of the search mode
radio button.}

\item{radio_btn_search_by_name_id}{Character. The ID value that indicates search
by vernacular name mode.}

\item{search_by_ver_or_sci_name}{Character. The primary search term entered
by the user.}

\item{selected_by_ver_or_sci_name}{Character. The secondary selection made
by the user.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the filtered biodiversity data that matches
both the vernacular name and scientific name criteria.
}
\description{
This function subsets the biodiversity data based on user search criteria
for species by their vernacular name and scientific name.
The function handles two search modes determined by the radio button
selection.
}
\details{
The function behaves differently based on the search mode:
\itemize{
\item If radio_btn_search_by_name equals radio_btn_search_by_name_id, it filters by
vernacular name first (search_by_ver_or_sci_name) and then
by scientific name (selected_by_ver_or_sci_name).
\item Otherwise, it filters by scientific name first (search_by_ver_or_sci_name) and
then by vernacular name (selected_by_ver_or_sci_name).
}
}
