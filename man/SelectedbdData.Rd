\title{Filter biodiversity data based on search criteria}
\usage{
SelectedbdData(
  radioBtn_search_byName,
  radioBtn_search_byNameID,
  searchByVerOrSciName,
  selectedByVerOrSciName
)
}
\arguments{
\item{radioBtn_search_byName}{Character. The current value of the search mode radio button.}

\item{radioBtn_search_byNameID}{Character. The ID value that indicates search by vernacular name mode.}

\item{searchByVerOrSciName}{Character. The primary search term entered by the user.}

\item{selectedByVerOrSciName}{Character. The secondary selection made by the user.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the filtered biodiversity data that matches both
the vernacular name and scientific name criteria.
}
\description{
This function subsets the biodiversity data based on user search criteria
for species by their vernacular name and scientific name. The function handles
two search modes determined by the radio button selection.
}
\details{
The function behaves differently based on the search mode:
\itemize{
\item If radioBtn_search_byName equals radioBtn_search_byNameID, it filters by vernacular name
first (searchByVerOrSciName) and then by scientific name (selectedByVerOrSciName).
\item Otherwise, it filters by scientific name first (searchByVerOrSciName) and then
by vernacular name (selectedByVerOrSciName).
}
}
